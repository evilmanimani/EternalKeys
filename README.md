Grenade and dash Autohotkey macros for Doom Eternal

This script allows you to double-tap the movement keys to dash in any direction, and optionally to dash continuously while holding the movement key after triggering the shortcut.

In addition to this, it allows you to set a separate hotkey for frag and ice grenades, thus eliminating the need for the equipment switch key, which never made sense since there's only the two nades to swap between anyways.
This relies on the imagesearch function of AutoHotkey to check the state of the grenade icon on your hud. In the zip I included samples for the default hud color at 1080p, however you may need to clip those yourself depending on your hud color and resolution. For best results, take a small clip, and black out as much as possible like shown in the examples. If you get one that works well for you, consider doing a pull request to add them to the refimages dir.

For the default config, Middle mouse & left control will fire a frag, while Xbutton1 & H will fire an ice grenade.
